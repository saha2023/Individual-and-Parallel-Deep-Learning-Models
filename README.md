# Individual-and-Parallel-Deep-Learning-Models

[ArkajyotiSaha.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20843408/ArkajyotiSaha.pdf)

This report evaluates the performance of individual
and parallel deep learning models on the MNIST and
CIFAR-10 datasets. Using pre-trained models-VGG16,
ResNet18, and GoogLeNet-we adapt them through trans-
fer learning with a two-phase approach: feature extrac-
tion followed by fine-tuning. We explore parallel archi-
tectures combining features from two models, defined
as f(x) = [f1(x),f2(x)] where f1 and f2 are fea-
ture extractors. Results indicate that parallel models,
such as ResNet18 + GoogLeNet, achieve a top accuracy
of 99.55% on MNIST, slightly outperforming individual
models (e.g., ResNet18 at 99.49%). On CIFAR-10, in-
dividual GoogLeNet excels at 95.17%, surpassing paral-
lel configurations like ResNet18 + GoogLeNet (94.94%).
These findings highlight dataset complexityâ€™s impact on
model efficacy, with parallel models showing marginal
gains on simpler tasks.

## Three Parallel Model Combinations
This research evaluated three specific parallel combinations: ResNet18+GoogLeNet, VGG16+GoogLeNet, and ResNet18+VGG16. Each combination brings together different architectural philosophies and parameter counts.

## Training Workflow and Two-Phase Approach
The training methodology employed a sophisticated two-phase strategy that optimizes both feature extraction and fine-tuning phases. This approach leverages transfer learning principles while allowing task-specific adaptation.
Phase 1 involves freezing pre-trained weights and training only the classification layer for 5 epochs. Phase 2 unfreezes all layers and fine-tunes the entire network with differentiated learning rates for 10 additional epochs. This methodology proved highly effective across all tested architectures.
